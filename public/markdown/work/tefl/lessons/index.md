> These lessons focus on English for software development — helping developers improve technical communication, teamwork, and clarity when working in English-speaking engineering environments

[PageGrid pages="/work/tefl/lessons/accepting-tickets"]

#### Technical Stand-Ups and Status Updates

A session on speaking skills for daily stand-ups and asynchronous status posts. It teaches a simple structure for explaining blockers, progress, and next steps. Learners work on clarity, brevity, and confidence — avoiding over-long explanations while still giving enough detail for a team to act on.

#### Bug Reports and Issue Tracking

A writing module centred on JIRA/GitHub Issues. It covers how to describe reproduction steps, expected behaviour, environment details, and impact. The lesson helps learners avoid vague phrasing and adopt the concise, action-oriented style expected in engineering teams.

#### Working in English-Speaking Teams

A communication module that introduces the unwritten norms of English-language engineering culture: hedging, softening, tone control, and diplomatic disagreement. It includes practical scripts for planning, clarifying requirements, asking for help, and negotiating deadlines.
