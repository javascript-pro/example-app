> Level 5 TEFL Diploma, a UK-regulated teaching credential

The Level 5 TEFL Diploma is a UK-regulated teaching qualification at the same level as a foundation degree. It’s overseen by Ofqual, which means the syllabus, assessments, and learning outcomes meet national education standards rather than being “just another online certificate”.

#### What it covers

- Core grammar and language systems
- Lesson planning, scaffolding, and classroom management
- Teaching reading, writing, listening, and speaking
- Pronunciation and phonology
- Error correction and feedback techniques
- Needs analysis and designing targeted lessons
- Teaching English for Specific Purposes (ESP), including business and technical English
- Using digital tools and AI effectively in language teaching
- A full practicum/teaching portfolio to demonstrate competence

> Internationally recognised: Accepted by reputable schools, online platforms, and employers worldwide.

Professional depth: Goes far beyond basic 120-hour TEFL certificates; it prepares you to design and deliver high-quality lessons.

Credibility: Ofqual regulation gives it weight and signals that you’ve completed a structured, assessed programme.

Better job access and pay: Level 5 credentials are often preferred for more specialised or higher-paid online teaching roles.

Strong foundation for niches: Particularly useful for teaching English to developers, where clear technical communication matters.
