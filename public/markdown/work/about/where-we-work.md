> Corporate attitudes to remote working have changed dramatically in recent years.

## How we work

Many businesses were hesitant to allow employees to work remotely, citing concerns about productivity, communication, and collaboration. However, the pandemic forced many businesses to adopt remote work policies, and they quickly discovered that employees could be just as productive and engaged when working from home

As a result of this positive experience, many businesses have now embraced remote work as a permanent part of their operations. A recent survey by PwC found that 83% of employers now say the shift to remote work has been successful for their company, and 67% plan to offer more remote work options in the future
