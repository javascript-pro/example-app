Before the frameworks, before npm, before it ate the world—we were already deep in the language that powers the modern web.

- We’ve built Flash apps in ActionScript.
- We’ve written jQuery plugins by hand.
- We’ve moved through Vanilla JS, React, and beyond.
- We’ve worked in Node.js since 2006.

And through it all, one thing has remained constant: _ECMA Script_.

> We’ve been writing JavaScript since it was called ECMAScript.

[ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (/ˈɛkməskrɪpt/; ES) is a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. It is best known as a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. It is standardized by Ecma International in the document ECMA-262

> Always JavaScript even when it wasn’t

- _ActionScript?_ Flash’s scripting language was basically JavaScript with a stricter compiler.
- _jQuery?_ That was us hiding from browser inconsistencies—but it was still JavaScript underneath.
- _React?_ Just a way of writing better JavaScript components.
- _Node?_ JavaScript on the server. A game changer.

We’ve used it for UI, logic, APIs, real-time systems, build tooling, browser extensions, PWAs, even art projects.

If it runs JavaScript, we’ve probably shipped something on it.
