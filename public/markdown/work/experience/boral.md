#### Geo-Spatial Fleet App

_React Developer, Aug 2018 - Feb 2019, Sydney_

It’s only been a few years since all of Boral’s business was still done on paper. When I joined the Sydney tech team in 2018, the company was mid-transformation. Full of talented people and legacy systems coexisting.

I joined a strong Agile team led by a Product Owner, who had assembled a cross-functional group of contractors to form a kind of rapid-prototyping unit. We had solid backend engineers, frontend specialists, and everything in between — all focused on exploring new ways to bring Boral’s data to life.

The challenge was typical of a large enterprise: years of evolving microservices, inconsistent versioning, and fragmented data sources. We turned to GraphQL to unify those systems — collating information from multiple APIs and delivering it cleanly to the frontend.

Our focus was a real-time geo-spatial prototype, powered by data streamed from smartphones across a fleet of 200+ vehicles nationwide. The goal was simple but powerful: grab the live location data, enrich it with contextual information, and display it beautifully on a map.

Voila. Dots on a Map. A functional prototype ready for the governance board to explore and iterate on.

### What I Brought to the Team

- **Captain’s Duty** – times I took ownership, showed integrity, and followed through without being asked

When communication gaps emerged between our frontend and backend engineers particularly between our young Chinese frontend developer and her backend counterpart. I suggested they use GraphQL as their shared language. This bridge helped them collaborate effectively, freeing me to focus on state management, ensuring every component aligned into a cohesive working app.

- **Fun Loving Heart** How I brought positive energy, supported teammates, and helped create an enjoyable, hard-working environment?

The first time we actually tested the App fully I rode home with a smartphone in my pocket which the product owner showed his bosses the little icon of my bike heading to Narrabeen

- **Athlete’s Grit** – examples of when I pushed through challenges and delivered under pressure?

Obviously in such an environment priorities can change daily and keeping flexible to those changes is a full time job

#### Technical Highlights

- Established foundational test architecture using Cucumber, Gherkin, and BDD principles
- Developed and tested multiple React PWAs with AWS Amplify and GraphQL
- Built CI/CD workflows to support rapid feature delivery and iterative feedback loops
