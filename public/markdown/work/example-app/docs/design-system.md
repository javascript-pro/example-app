> Material UI is a React component library that provides a consistent design system, layout primitives, and ready-made UI components

[GitHub url="https://github.com/javascript-pro/core/tree/master/gl-core/cartridges/Theme" label="Theme Cartridge"]

#### Foundation for all shared UI

– MUI’s ThemeProvider establishes colours, typography, spacing and breakpoints

– Components like Card, Grid, Box, Button, Dialog, Typography form the structural building blocks of all shared layouts

– Custom elements (StandardCard, ConfirmDialog, PageGrid, etc.) wrap these primitives to enforce Goldlabel’s design language while staying flexible across cartridges and apps
