> **Nasi Goreng** is an Indonesian dish made from leftover rice stir-fried with garlic, shallots, chilli, and sweet soy sauce (kecap manis). Often enriched with prawns, chicken, or beef. Usually finished with prawn crackers a fried egg and a side of crisp cucumber

If you are also [Generation X](/balance/books/douglas-coupland/generation-x) then maybe you travelled in Indonesia and remember Nasi Goreng as being the most delisious thing in the world ever, but you've never been able to recreate it?

Extra Doubleplus Bonus for having either or both of these specialist ingredients which would _really_ seal the flavour deal and take you back to climbing Mt Rinjani on Lombok.

## Main flavours

- Sweet and sticky from kecap manis
- Umami and slight funk from shrimp paste
- Heat from chillies
- Aromatics from garlic and shallot
- A little tang from tamarind or lime

### Kecap manis

Indonesian sweet soy sauce. Thick, glossy, caramel-like, and built from soy sauce reduced with palm sugar plus aromatics (garlic, star anise, galangal, bay leaf).

### Nasi Goreng paste

Nasi Goreng paste is a concentrated seasoning blend used to build the core flavour of Indonesian fried rice. It usually contains sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), garlic, shallot, chilli, tamarind, shrimp paste, and warm spices such as coriander and galangal. It gives the dish its deep caramel colour and the balance of sweet, savoury, spicy, and smoky-fermented notes.

#### How to use the paste

You fry the paste first. A teaspoon or two goes into hot oil so it can cook out, darken slightly, and perfume the pan. Once fragrant, you add protein and vegetables, then finally cold cooked rice so the paste coats the grains evenly. A splash of kecap manis at the end tightens the colour and seasoning.

#### How not to use the paste

- Adding the paste too late: you end up with raw, harsh flavours.
- Using warm or freshly cooked rice: it turns mushy instead of smoky and separate.
- Using too much paste: the dish becomes cloying, overly sweet, or sludge-like.

If you want to recreate authentically traditional Nasi Goreng from scratch,first have a chinese the night before. There's always some berk who's ordered too much rice and nobody likes cold boily rice hanging round the fridge
