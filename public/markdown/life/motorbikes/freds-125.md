I have a love/hate relationship with this bike. After all it is the machine to which I actually lost toes. I rode it a bit close to a rock and squished my foot between the rock and the peg.

The bike wasn't very legal. It wasn't even mine. It was Fred's but he didn't have the papers for me to buy it off him properly. I just hooned around France on it. English plates, no insurance. Cops didn't give a shit

So finally we get round to trying to transfer ownership which involved getting a mate of Freds to register it in his name and then transfer it to us. I forget why, but in the meantime the geezer died.

Dead man's bike, innit
