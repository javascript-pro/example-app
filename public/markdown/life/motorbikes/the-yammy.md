> The Virago

Definately my favourite bike so far. The Virago was 20 years old and went like it. I had it for a few years on the East coat of Australia. Used to go fishing on it and everything

#### Boring Stuff

In 1988 a 250 cc Virago was added. A short production of 125 cc was also manufactured. Yamaha made models which were chain driven, other models were equipped with shaft drive.

The larger-displacement Viragos were eventually phased out of production, replaced by the V-Star and Road Star series of motorbikes. The engines lived on, however.

The facelifted version of the original XV750/1100 powerplant was used in the V-star. The last motorcycle to bear the Virago name was the 2007 Virago 250.
