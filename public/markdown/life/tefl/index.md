> Level 5 TEFL Diploma, a UK-regulated teaching credential

[PageGrid pages="/work/tefl/lessons, /work/tefl/lessons/github-commit"]

The qualification underway is a Level 5 TEFL Diploma, a UK-regulated teaching credential equivalent to a foundation-level qualification. It’s internationally recognised and designed for professional English teaching, with modules covering grammar, lesson planning, communication skills, and the use of AI in language learning.

#### Lessons

#### Technical Stand-Ups and Status Updates

A session on speaking skills for daily stand-ups and asynchronous status posts. It teaches a simple structure for explaining blockers, progress, and next steps. Learners work on clarity, brevity, and confidence — avoiding over-long explanations while still giving enough detail for a team to act on.

#### Bug Reports and Issue Tracking

A writing module centred on JIRA/GitHub Issues. It covers how to describe reproduction steps, expected behaviour, environment details, and impact. The lesson helps learners avoid vague phrasing and adopt the concise, action-oriented style expected in engineering teams.

#### Working in English-Speaking Teams

A communication module that introduces the unwritten norms of English-language engineering culture: hedging, softening, tone control, and diplomatic disagreement. It includes practical scripts for planning, clarifying requirements, asking for help, and negotiating deadlines.
