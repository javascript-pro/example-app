A practical module built around the language developers use when contributing to a codebase. The lesson covers the structure of clear commit messages, the tone expected in professional teams, and how to describe changes precisely. Learners practise writing concise commit summaries, explaining intent, and using conventional commit styles.

The session also introduces the vocabulary of version control — “diff”, “staging”, “pushing”, “branching”, “merge conflicts” — with short, realistic examples from everyday workflows. The goal is to help non-native developers communicate their work clearly, avoid misunderstandings in code reviews, and adopt team-friendly commit habits.
