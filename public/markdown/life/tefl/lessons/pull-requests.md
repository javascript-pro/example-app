A follow-on lesson focusing on the language of collaboration. It shows how to write polite, direct, and technically accurate pull request descriptions. Learners practise giving feedback that is constructive, specific, and culturally appropriate for English-speaking engineering teams. The module includes example phrases for requesting changes, explaining decisions, and discussing trade-offs without sounding blunt or hesitant.
