> Lesson: How to Accept and Work on a Ticket

### 1. Purpose of Accepting a Ticket

Accepting a ticket signals ownership. It tells the team the work has a clear driver and gives stakeholders confidence that progress is underway.

### 2. What a Good Acceptance Comment Does

* Confirms you’re taking responsibility
* Shows understanding of the problem
* Sets expectations for approach and scope
* Reassures the team you’ll deliver safely

### 3. Example Acceptance Comment

> “Happy to take this one. The current search is stable but basic, so the goal is to improve matching, relevance, and UI behaviour to make the whole flow feel more intuitive. Work will be delivered in small, safe increments to keep everything stable.”

### 4. Why This Works

* Positive tone shows engagement
* Clear understanding of the current state
* Realistic goals set the direction
* Incremental delivery reduces risk

### 5. Steps After Accepting the Ticket

1. Re-read the description to confirm requirements
2. Identify unknowns — ask clarifying questions early
3. Break the work down into small, deliverable parts
4. Plan your first commit (setup, refactor, or tests)
5. Communicate progress through updates and small PRs
6. Close the ticket once tested and merged

### 6. Common Mistakes

* Accepting work without understanding it
* Silent ownership (no comment, no updates)
* Taking on too much in one go
* Delivering a big, risky PR

### 7. Mini-Exercise for Learners

Write your own acceptance comment for this scenario: 

A button in the UI sometimes fails to respond on mobile devices.
