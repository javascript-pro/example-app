R. F. Kuang was born on May 29th, 1996, in Guangzhou, China. She immigrated to the United States with her family when she was four years old. Her father grew up in Leiyang, in Hunan province, and her mother grew up in Hainan province. Her maternal grandfather fought for Chiang Kai-shek. Her father's family experienced the Japanese occupation of Hunan during World War II.

Kuang's Babel was excluded from consideration for the 2023 Hugo Award along with Chinese Canadian author Xiran Jay Zhao's Iron Widow. The awards ceremony that year was held in Chengdu, China, and leaked emails later revealed that an administrator had recommended that books whose content might prove controversial in China be excluded from the list of nominees.
