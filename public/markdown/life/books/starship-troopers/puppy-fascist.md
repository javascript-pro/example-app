> Punishment is a natural and necessary part of enforcing social order

In Starship Troopers, Lieutenant Colonel Jean V. Dubois uses the example of puppy training to argue that punishment is a natural and necessary part of enforcing social order. His analogy appears in the civics lessons where he challenges the students’ assumptions about “cruelty,” “violence,” and “authority.”

“Suppose you merely scolded your puppy, never punished him … let him go on making messes in the house … and occasionally locked him up … and then one day you notice that he is now a grown dog … whereupon you … shoot him dead.”

“I didn’t then know what a sadist was — but I knew pups. … You scold him … rub his nose in it … paddle him so that he darn well won’t do it again … you have to do it right away!”

Heinlein uses Dubois as a mouthpiece for the book’s political theory. Critics often highlight this puppy analogy because it distils the core ideology of the novel; order arises from disciplined citizens, and discipline ultimately rests on force.

It’s one of the clearest moments where the novel’s political philosophy crosses into the territory that readers and scholars identify as fascistic.

#### The analogy

Dubois describes a puppy that keeps misbehaving—chewing shoes, fouling the house, etc.

If you never punish it, the puppy does not learn cause and effect. It grows into a dog that still behaves badly and eventually must be destroyed.

His moral: failing to discipline is more cruel than the short, sharp punishment that teaches correct behaviour early.

#### How this ties to fascist logic

Dubois uses the puppy story to frame a political point:

- Authority must come from the ability to enforce rules, including violent enforcement when needed.
- Punishment is essential for shaping citizens’ behaviour and securing the state.
- Leniency equals moral irresponsibility because it leads to larger, more destructive consequences.

This worldview maps neatly onto fascist principles:

- Dubois argues that discipline has to be imposed, and this mirrors the fascist belief that an authoritarian hierarchy is essential.

- He treats violence as a legitimate tool for maintaining order, which aligns with the fascist idea that state power ultimately comes from force.

- His insistence that citizens must be taught correct behaviour parallels the fascist emphasis on conformity as a moral duty.

- And when he claims that leniency leads to decay, he echoes the fascist view that strength and severity are virtues in themselves.

- Dubois isn’t calling the Federation fascist in-universe, but the reasoning aligns with fascist justification for coercion: violence is not only acceptable but morally required to shape society.
